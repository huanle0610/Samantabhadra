Can I use American Express card for that?

Could I cash this personal check from London Bank?

Oh, by the way.There is a chance I'll be staying one more day, so I might 
be leaving on Saturday, is that ok?

Let me check. Well, sir, I'm afraid we're all booked up for Friday night, 
 but something may open up. Can I let you know?

OK, If you could let me know as soon as possible, I would appreciate it.

What was the price of the room again?

That room $120 a night.

Is that correct, sir?

Yes, that's fine.

I'm afraid that isn't possible.

I'm sorry, but the manager, Mr Grover, is out right now.
