## Cultural Change

Do you like holidays?

Absolutely, yes.

During holidays, we can relax, or go traveling.

Do you know anyone who hates holidays?

Chinese officers from Han to Qing dynasty have a special holiday called ‘ding you’, which lasts for three years. During the holidays, they usually have regular salary and would be reinstated after that.

But no one likes this holiday. Why?

Ding You is a holiday for officers who lost parent or other important relatives in tenure. So you know how much they hope to escape “the holiday's blessing”?

For the holiday is so long, some people enjoy working more; so they may conceal the mourning. 

What will the consequence be?

Mostly death is the answer. 


In traditional Chinese culture, filial piety is the most important character of a man especially for an officer. Parents take care of kids at least three years, so three years mourning period is inevitable. During the period, people need to live near the grave, stopping any kinds of entertainments.

Lot of people got convicted for misconduct during the period in history.

We Chinese saw our domain as the self-sufficient center of the universe;

Chinese people pay more attention to the quality of life, the pursuit of spirit to enjoy.

 The ruling classes thought if they have more people and more lands, they would be the strongest one.
 
Scholars , peasants , workers and businessman was the kernel structure of traditional Chinese society. They weren't wild about high GDP growth.

The monarch of country would fast many days to pray raining in times of drought. 

Every year they prayed the weather was favorable, and thanked the God if it would be. 

Lots of officers were artists also.

They contributed many popular articles to our Chinese textbook. While Chinese officials today put lots of memory challenge tasks in the politics textbook.

In my opinion, we are what we think. Culture is the basis for all the other.

Modern China went through three significant changes of culture.

The first one is the May 4th Movement in 1919.

The second one is the  Great Cultural Revolution between 1966 and 1976.

The Reform and opening-up began from 1978 is the third one. 

Thanks to those revolutions, the progress of the social economy was remarkable. But we also paid the price for radical cultural change.

We use concrete-and-glass towers to replace clear water and green mountains. Attachments to money prevailed, moral got weaker. So our chairman said “reform and opening up only transpires in the progressive sense – there is no end to it”.

There's no doubt China will absorb more essence of Chinese traditional culture to keep the balance between economic and social development.

It's no use to accuse cultural changes. For Chinese always insisted the Middle Way, it is necessary to have a few radical cultural revolutions.

I'm Chinese, I love my motherland!
