# Numbers
## Numerical Operation
\+ the addition sign, which means to add or take the sum of two numbers.

\- the subtraction sign, which means to subtract or take the difference of two numbers.

a + b = c

* The sum of a and b is c.
* a plus b equals c.

a - b = c

* The difference of a and b is c.
* a minus b is equal to c.

\* the sign for multiplication
\/ the sign for division

a * b = x

* a times b equals x.
* a multiplied by b is x.

(a+b)*c

* the sum of a and b multiplied by b
 
a/b

* a is divided by b; or a over b

(c-b)/a

* the difference of c and b divided by a

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
